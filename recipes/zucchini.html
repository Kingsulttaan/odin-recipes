    <p><h2>The zucchini</h2></p>
    <p><em>You need to follow the following steps in order to prepare this meal:</em></p>
    <ol>
              <li>Start by washing the zucchini under cold running water. This removes any dirt or debris from the surface.</li>
              <li>Cut off both ends of the zucchini. The stem end and the blossom end are usually tougher and less flavorful.</li>
 <li>Zucchini can be prepared in various ways, such as sautéing, roasting, grilling, baking, or even using it raw in salads. Choose the method that suits your dish and taste preferences.</li>
 <li>Depending on your chosen preparation method, you'll need to slice the zucchini appropriately. For sautéing, grilling, or roasting, you might want to slice it into rounds or lengthwise strips. For baking or stuffing, you might need to halve or quarter it</li>
 <li>Season the zucchini with your choice of herbs, spices, and seasonings. Common options include salt, pepper, garlic, thyme, rosemary, basil, and oregano. A drizzle of olive oil can also enhance the flavor.</li>
 <li>Cooking. Here are a few common cooking methods:
              <p><ul>
                   <li><strong>Sautéing:</strong> Heat a pan over medium-high heat, add a little oil, and sauté the zucchini slices until they're tender and slightly browned</li> 
                   <li><strong>Roasting:</strong> Preheat the oven to around 400°F (200°C). Toss the zucchini slices with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread them out on a baking sheet and roast in the oven until they're golden and tender.</li>  
                   <li><strong>Grilling:</strong> Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Brush the zucchini slices with oil and grill them for a few minutes on each side until they're grill-marked and cooked through.</li>      
                   <li><strong>Baking:</strong> If you're using zucchini in a casserole or stuffed dish, follow the recipe instructions for baking.</li>
                   
              </ul></p>
</li>
<li>Tasting and Adjusting:
Once the zucchini is cooked, taste a piece to check if it's seasoned to your liking. Adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
